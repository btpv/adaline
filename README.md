# adaline
This repository is a complete design instruction to enable users to recreate the Widrow-Hoff Adaline demonstrator (as originally conceived by Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff) in 1960.
The design is modernised using digital peripherals and an Arduino Uno microcontroller to make the design as inexpensive as possible (total cost is approximately $62)
The aim of the project is to encourage educators to build their own devices to help explore the concept of the Least Mean Square algorithm and disseminate the concepts more widely
perhaps among Schools and Colleges.

Here is a video demonstrating how to train the device: https://youtu.be/jZf1iUhlR3M

Here is a link to a video (from 2012) which inspired this project.  It features none other than Prof Bernard Widrow himself demonstrating his Adaline device: https://youtu.be/hc2Zj55j1zU and Part 2: https://youtu.be/skfNlwEbqck
